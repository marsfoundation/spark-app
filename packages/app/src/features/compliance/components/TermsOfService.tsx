    The Site displays information publicly available on blockchain systems related to third party protocols, including
    Spark, and may offer interaction methods for use with a third-party wallet application or device based on such
    information, but the Site Operator cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information or that interactions will have
    the intended outcome. For example, displayed asset values reflect on-chain data provided by certain third party
    protocols according to such protocol's mechanics and governance procedures, including MakerDAO, and such protocol's
    are outside the Site's control and are subject to change. Furthermore, such protocols may be adversely affected by
    malfunctions, bugs, defects, malfunctions, hacking, theft, attacks, negligent coding or design choices, or changes
    to the applicable protocol rules, which may expose you to a risk of total loss and forfeiture of all relevant
    digital assets. Site Operator assumes no liability or responsibility for any of the foregoing matters, including
    asset value pricing, and you are responsible for understanding the risks of the third party protocols you interact
    with and keeping up to date with protocol or governance changes for such protocols.

    Your use of the Site is conditioned on your acknowledgement and understanding of the potential risks and regulatory
    issues as further described in the <ToSLink />, and you agree to hold the Site Operator harmless from such risks.
    All functions interacting with third party protocols on the Site are autonomous and if something goes wrong with the
    smart contracts, there is no recourse against a private individual or legal entity. Similarly, while the Site
    provides information regarding such protocols, the Site Operator is not responsible for issues with the protocols.
    The Site Operator cannot access or control deposits or transactions initiated through the Site. The Site Operator
    has no control over Spark, MakerDAO or other third party protocols or other frontends. Site Operator does not and
    will not enter into any legal or factual relationship with any user of such protocols beyond provision and
    maintenance of the Site.
